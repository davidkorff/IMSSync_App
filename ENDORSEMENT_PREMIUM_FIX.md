# Endorsement Premium Application Fix

## Problem Summary
The endorsement premium was NOT being applied in IMS despite the test showing success. The issue was a **double premium application** problem.

## Root Cause Analysis

### What Was Happening:
1. `Triton_EndorsePolicy_WS` stored procedure was inserting premium directly into `tblQuoteOptionPremiums`
2. Then `spProcessTritonPayload` was trying to apply premium via `UpdatePremiumHistoricV3`
3. When `bind_endorsement=True`, the quote was already bound, causing "Can't modify premiums on a bound policy" error
4. When `bind_endorsement=False`, there was still a conflict with double premium application

### How Ascot Does It:
- They use `spCopyQuote` to create the endorsement (same as us)
- They have a separate `UpdateEndorsementPremiums` procedure that:
  - Deletes existing premium rows for the charge code
  - Inserts new premium rows
  - Updates `tblQuoteOptionGeneric`
- They handle premium separately from the endorsement creation

## The Fix

### 1. SQL Stored Procedure Changes
**Created:** `create_Triton_EndorsePolicy_WS_V3.sql`
- Removed the premium insertion section (lines 161-187 from V2)
- Let `spProcessTritonPayload` handle premium via `UpdatePremiumHistoricV3`
- This ensures consistent premium handling across all transaction types

### 2. Python Code Changes
**File:** `app/services/transaction_handler.py`
- Set `bind_endorsement=False` when creating endorsement (lines 230 & 239)
- This allows the proper flow:
  1. Create endorsement quote (not bound)
  2. Apply premium via `spProcessTritonPayload`
  3. Bind the endorsement

## Correct Flow After Fix:
1. **Create Endorsement:** `Triton_EndorsePolicy_WS` creates endorsement quote (NOT bound, NO premium insertion)
2. **Apply Premium:** `spProcessTritonPayload` calls `UpdatePremiumHistoricV3` to properly register premium
3. **Bind:** `bind_service.bind_quote()` binds the endorsement with premium correctly applied

## Testing Required:
1. Deploy the new V3 stored procedure to IMS_DEV
2. Test midterm endorsement with the updated flow
3. Verify premium appears correctly in IMS
4. Confirm invoice generation works

## Key Learning:
- Don't apply premium in multiple places
- Follow a consistent pattern: Create Quote → Apply Premium → Bind
- `UpdatePremiumHistoricV3` is the proper way to handle premium calculations (handles proration, etc.)
