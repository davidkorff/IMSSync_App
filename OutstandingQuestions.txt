# Outstanding Questions for IMS Integration

## Business Questions
- Do we need to track producers and underwriter information from external systems (like Tritan)?
- Get the IMS config details from Alyson.
- Do we vary the billing type by submission? What are the valid BillingTypeID values?
- Does commission vary by policy? How should we calculate CompanyCommission vs ProducerCommission?
- What should QuoteStatusID be set to for new submissions? What states are available?
- What are the expected values for TermsOfPayment? (Specifically for `ims_one` environment)
- Do we need to set all fields in RiskInformation or are some optional?
- What is the process for handling invalid/missing GUIDs? Should we create new entities or require pre-existence?
- What entities should we create programmatically vs. requiring manual setup first?
- What is the appropriate match threshold for producer matching in production use?
- Should producer matching be interactive in production or fully automated?
- How should we handle cases where producer names don't match well between systems?
- For a given Producer (e.g., "H&H Insurance Services", `ProducerLocationID = 19817`), what is its `ProducerLocationGUID` in `ims_one`? (Or confirm lookup strategy via `ProducerContactGUID` or name is sufficient).
- How do we map the incoming CSV "Program" column (e.g., "Allied Health", "Middle Market") to a specific IMS `ProgramCode` or `ProgramID` for the `ims_one` environment, especially in conjunction with `LineGUID`?
- What are the valid `TermsOfPaymentID` values for `ims_one`, or is it auto-assigned?
- Insured Business Type `InsuredBusinessTypeID = 21` was used in the sample quote for "Amit Test". What business type string does this ID represent? Should "Individual" map to ID 4 or another ID based on `ims_one` practice?
- Coverage from CSV: If a policy from Tritan (via CSV structure) has multiple distinct coverage types (e.g., implied by "Limit" vs "Limit (General Liability)"), how should these be represented in the initial API call (Part 1 of intake)? Does each need to be a separate entry in `PolicySubmission.coverages`? How is premium allocated if only a total is provided?

## Technical Questions
- How do we map text identifiers from source systems to IMS GUIDs?
- What are the appropriate IMS API calls to look up entities by name/text?
- What is the authentication token lifespan? Do we need to refresh it during long runs?
- How should we handle errors and retries? Is there a rate limit for API calls?
- Are there any batch processing capabilities in IMS API to improve performance?
- How do we handle duplicate submissions (same policy number)?
- How to handle or validate the encrypted passwords in the config?
- What format should dates be in for the IMS API calls?
- How should we handle timezone differences between systems?
- How frequently should we regenerate the producer mapping file?
- What algorithms provide the best fuzzy matching results for producer names?
- Should we implement a feedback loop for improving producer matching over time?
- What logging requirements do we need for tracking policies migrated to IMS?
- How should we implement an alerting system for integration errors?
- If using DataAccess calls for integration, what are the limitations vs direct API calls?

## Integration Challenges
- How do we map Program and Line of business from source system to IMS?
- What fields in the source data should be used to identify unique policies?
- What validation should be performed on source data before attempting to create IMS submissions?
- How do we handle missing required fields in the source data?
- Should we generate a mapping file for external producer/underwriter to IMS GUIDs?
- How frequently will the integration run? Is it a one-time load or ongoing?
- How do we ensure producer mappings remain accurate when producers change in either system?
- What performance requirements exist for batch producer matching?
- Should producer matching be centralized or implemented in each gatherer?
- Is a push model from Tritan to IMS (using DataAccess) more efficient than our current approach?

## CSV Source Data Specifics
- Do we need to handle all columns in the CSV or just the core data?
- How do we parse the limit and deductible fields which contain currency formatting?
- How should we handle the count vs. count (prior) fields?
- What is the meaning of "O/P" in the Transaction Type?
- How should producer information be formatted in CSV files for most reliable matching?

## Additional Question
- What is the recommended method for storing detailed third-party rater data within IMS, beyond just premium components or attached documents? Is there a "Dynamic_data" table or similar concept, and how would it be populated via web services (e.g., custom stored procedure via DataAccess.asmx)?
