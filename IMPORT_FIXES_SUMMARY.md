# Import Fixes Summary

## Changes Made to Fix Import Errors

### 1. **app/services/ims/workflow_orchestrator.py**
- **Line 22**: Already fixed
  ```python
  from app.services.ims.invoice_service import InvoiceService as IMSInvoiceService
  ```

### 2. **app/services/ims/__init__.py**
- **Added** the missing import and export:
  ```python
  from app.services.ims.invoice_service import InvoiceService as IMSInvoiceService
  ```
  - Added `'IMSInvoiceService'` to `__all__` list

### 3. **app/services/ims/invoice_service.py**
- **Updated** constructor to accept environment parameter for compatibility:
  ```python
  class InvoiceService:
      def __init__(self, environment: Optional[str] = None):
          self.environment = environment  # For compatibility, but not used
          self.soap_client = None
          self._initialized = False
  ```

## Summary

All import errors should now be fixed. The issue was:
1. The import statement was already correct
2. But `IMSInvoiceService` wasn't exported from the `__init__.py` 
3. And the `InvoiceService` class wasn't accepting the `environment` parameter that `workflow_orchestrator.py` was passing

Now you can push these changes and the service should start without import errors.

## To Run After Pushing:
```bash
cd /opt/IMSSync_App
git pull  # or however you sync the code
python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8001 --reload
```
