# RSG Integration Progress Document
Last Updated: 2025-07-15

## Project Overview
Building a service that processes insurance transactions from Triton and transforms them into IMS API calls. The service handles 5 transaction types: Bind, Unbind, Issue, Midterm Endorsement, and Cancellation.

## Current Status: Ready for testing - All major issues fixed

### What We've Accomplished ‚úÖ

1. **Project Structure**
   - Created modular FastAPI service with separate IMS service modules
   - Implemented base service pattern for IMS SOAP clients
   - Set up Docker configuration and environment management
   - Created comprehensive test scripts

2. **Authentication**
   - Fixed authentication from `Login` (wrong method) to `LoginIMSUser`
   - Successfully authenticating with IMS using encrypted credentials
   - Token management with auto-refresh

3. **Insured Creation**
   - Successfully creating insureds with proper object structure
   - Fixed BusinessTypeID from 1 to 9 (LLC - Partnership)
   - Insured search working correctly

4. **Submission Creation**
   - Successfully creating submissions with proper object structure
   - Using valid Producer GUID from environment

### Current Issues üîß

1. ~~**Quote Creation - DateTime Format Error**~~ ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Converted dates from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD format

2. ~~**Quote Creation - Null Reference Error**~~ ‚úÖ FIXED
   - `AddQuoteWithInsured` method not available in this IMS instance
   - Fixed issues with AddQuote:
     - Changed empty strings to null values in RiskInformation
     - Removed TACSR field from quote object (only valid in submission)
     - AddQuote creates both submission and quote together (not separate calls)
     - Fixed decimal conversion error by converting commission rates from percentage to decimal
   - Current approach: AddInsured + AddQuote (which creates submission and quote)

3. ~~**RaterID Foreign Key Error**~~ ‚úÖ FIXED
   - Changed default RaterID from 1 to 0 to avoid foreign key constraint

4. ~~**BindQuote Method Signature Error**~~ ‚úÖ FIXED
   - BindQuote only accepts quoteGuid parameter, not policyNumber or bindDate
   - Removed extra parameters from the method call

5. ~~**Invalid OptionID Error**~~ ‚úÖ FIXED
   - BindQuote requires a quote option to be added first
   - Implemented AddQuoteOption method to create options before binding
   - Using the line GUID from environment

6. **Method Availability**
   - `AddQuoteWithSubmission` doesn't exist in this IMS instance
   - `AddQuoteWithInsured` also not available in this instance
   - Using fallback approach with separate API calls

7. **Data Storage Issues (Non-Blocking)**
   - UpdateExternalQuoteId: Missing stored procedure 'dbo.spAddExternalQuoteLink'
     - Error is caught and logged as warning
     - Transaction continues without storing external ID
   - ImportNetRateXml: Expects specific NetRate format, not general XML
     - Error is caught and logged as warning
     - Transaction continues without storing additional data

### Transaction Flow Progress

```
Bind Transaction (CURRENT FLOW):
1. ‚úÖ Authenticate with IMS
2. ‚úÖ Search for existing insured 
3. ‚úÖ Create insured if not found
4. ‚úÖ Create submission and quote with AddQuote
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Update external quote ID (UpdateExternalQuoteId) - Fails but continues (non-blocking)
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Store additional data (ImportNetRateXml) - Fails but continues (non-blocking)
7. ‚úÖ Add quote option (AddQuoteOption)
8. üîÑ Bind quote
9. ‚è∏Ô∏è Get invoice details
10. ‚è∏Ô∏è Store policy mapping

Legend: ‚úÖ Working | ‚ö†Ô∏è Failing (non-blocking) | ‚ùå Failing (blocking) | üîÑ Testing | ‚è∏Ô∏è Not implemented
```

### Key Learnings

1. **IMS API Expectations**
   - All methods expect complex objects, not individual parameters
   - Strict type requirements (e.g., BusinessTypeID must exist in DB)
   - Date formats need to be XML-compliant (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Some documented methods may not be available in all instances
   - AddQuote creates both submission and quote (not just quote)
   - TACSR field belongs in submission, not quote object

2. **Environment-Specific GUIDs**
   - Producer: 895E9291-CFB6-4299-8799-9AF77DF937D6
   - Underwriter: E4391D2A-58FB-4E2D-8B7D-3447D9E18C88
   - Company Location: DF35D4C7-C663-4974-A886-A1E18D3C9618
   - Line: 07564291-CBFE-4BBE-88D1-0548C88ACED4

### Recent Changes

1. **Implemented AddQuoteWithInsured** (Reverted - method not available)
   - Added new `create_quote_with_insured` method in QuoteService
   - Creates insured, location, submission, and quote in one atomic operation
   - Updated bind transaction flow to use this single-call approach
   - Eliminates null reference errors from multi-step process
   - **UPDATE**: Method doesn't exist in this IMS instance, reverted to multi-step approach

2. **Fixed Multiple Issues in Multi-Step Approach**
   - Fixed null reference error by changing empty strings to null in RiskInformation
   - Removed TACSR field from Quote object (only valid in Submission)
   - Fixed decimal conversion for commission rates (17.5% ‚Üí 0.175)
   - Fixed RaterID foreign key constraint (changed from 1 to 0)

3. **Fixed BindQuote Method Signature**
   - BindQuote only accepts quoteGuid parameter
   - Removed policyNumber and bindDate parameters that were causing errors
   - Ready for testing

4. **Implemented AddQuoteOption**
   - Added new `add_quote_option` method in QuoteService
   - Calls AddQuoteOption with quote GUID and line GUID
   - Added to bind flow between quote creation and binding
   - This creates the necessary option ID for binding

5. **Implemented Data Storage Solutions**
   - Updated ImportNetRateXml format to try NetRate-specific structure
   - Implemented AdditionalInformation fallback for storing Triton data
   - Added `_build_additional_info` helper method
   - Triton data now stored during quote creation in AdditionalInformation field
   - Each data point stored as "TRITON:key=value" format

### Data Storage Options for Extra Policy Details

**Option 1: AdditionalInformation Field (Currently Implemented)**
- **Method**: Store data in the AdditionalInformation array field during quote creation
- **Pros**: 
  - No additional API calls needed
  - Guaranteed to work (part of quote object)
  - Simple key-value storage
  - No database changes required
- **Cons**: 
  - Limited to string array format
  - Not easily queryable
  - May have size limitations
- **Implementation**: Store as "TRITON:key=value" strings

**Option 2: UpdateExternalQuoteId**
- **Method**: Use dedicated method to link external system IDs
- **Pros**: 
  - Purpose-built for external system integration
  - Clean separation of concerns
  - Potentially queryable
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires stored procedure 'dbo.spAddExternalQuoteLink' (currently missing)
  - Only stores external ID, not full data set
  - Additional API call required
- **Status**: Currently failing due to missing stored procedure

**Option 3: ImportNetRateXml**
- **Method**: Store XML data associated with quote
- **Pros**: 
  - Can store structured XML data
  - Designed for rating data storage
  - May support large data sets
- **Cons**: 
  - Expects specific NetRate XML format
  - May have side effects on rating
  - Additional API call required
  - Currently failing with format errors
- **Status**: Attempting with NetRate-specific format

**Option 4: ImportExcelRater**
- **Method**: Import Excel file with data as base64Binary
- **Pros**: 
  - Can store any data encoded in Excel format
  - Supports complex data structures
  - Returns premium calculations
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires creating Excel file format
  - May trigger rating calculations
  - Additional API call required
  - Overhead of Excel file creation
- **Parameters**: QuoteGuid, FileBytes (base64), FileName, RaterID, FactorSetGuid, ApplyFees

**Option 5: Custom XML Table with IMS Stored Procedure**
- **Method**: Create custom database table and stored procedure
- **Pros**: 
  - Full control over data structure
  - Highly queryable
  - Can store complex relationships
  - Scalable solution
- **Cons**: 
  - Requires database modifications
  - Requires custom stored procedure development
  - May need IMS vendor support
  - Most complex implementation
- **Implementation**: 
  - Create table (e.g., tblTritonQuoteData)
  - Create stored procedure (e.g., spAddTritonQuoteData_WS)
  - Use ExecuteCommand from DataAccess service
- **DataAccess Details**:
  - Service: `/dataaccess.asmx`
  - Method: `ExecuteCommand` for single results
  - Method: `ExecuteDataSet` for multiple rows
  - Auto-appends '_WS' to procedure names
  - Parameters passed as name-value pairs

**Option 6: Quote Notes/Comments**
- **Method**: Store data as notes attached to quote (if available)
- **Pros**: 
  - Human-readable
  - May be visible in IMS UI
  - Simple text storage
- **Cons**: 
  - May not be structured
  - Depends on notes functionality availability
  - Not easily queryable

**Current Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Primary**: AdditionalInformation field (implemented and working)
2. **Secondary**: Continue attempting UpdateExternalQuoteId and ImportNetRateXml
3. **Future**: Consider ImportExcelRater or custom table if more robust solution needed

**Recommendation for Production:**
- **Short-term**: Use AdditionalInformation (already working)
- **Medium-term**: Fix UpdateExternalQuoteId stored procedure for cleaner integration
- **Long-term**: Implement custom table solution for full queryability and scalability
- **Alternative**: If Excel-based workflows exist, consider ImportExcelRater

### Next Steps

1. **Test Current Implementation**
   - Run bind transaction with RaterID fix
   - Verify UpdateExternalQuoteId works
   - Monitor ImportNetRateXml behavior and response
   - Check for any unwanted side effects

2. **Complete Bind Flow**
   - ‚úÖ Create insured/quote 
   - ‚úÖ Update external ID
   - üîÑ Store additional data (testing approach)
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è Bind the quote
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è Get invoice details
   - ‚è∏Ô∏è Store policy mappings

3. **Implement Fallback if Needed**
   - If ImportNetRateXml causes issues, switch to AdditionalInformation
   - Update quote creation to include additional data

4. **Update Other Transactions**
   - Apply same data storage pattern to other transaction types
   - Ensure consistent approach across all flows

### Technical Debt

1. Need proper policy lookup mechanism (currently using file-based storage)
2. Error handling could be more specific
3. Need to implement retry logic for transient failures
4. Should add request/response logging for debugging

### Questions to Resolve

1. ~~Should we use `AddQuoteWithInsured` instead of separate calls?~~ - Method not available
2. ~~What's the correct date format for IMS?~~ - YYYY-MM-DD format required
3. Are there other required fields we're missing?
4. How do we handle policy lookups for existing policies?

### Current Work Status

**Implemented AddQuoteOption:**
- Added `add_quote_option` method to QuoteService
- Integrated into bind flow after quote creation
- Uses line GUID from environment
- Should fix the "Invalid OptionID specified" error

**Latest Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Insured created successfully
- ‚úÖ Quote created successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UpdateExternalQuoteId failed (missing stored procedure) - Non-blocking
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ImportNetRateXml failed (wrong format expected) - Non-blocking
- ‚ùå BindQuote failed with "Invalid OptionID" (now fixed with AddQuoteOption)

**New Field Added:**
- `prior_transaction_id` added to TEST.json to track policy changes/renewals

**Next Steps:**
1. Test bind flow with all fixes:
   - AddQuoteOption implementation
   - NetRate XML format update
   - AdditionalInformation data storage
2. Expect bind to succeed now
3. Complete invoice retrieval after successful bind
4. Test other transaction types
