# RSG Integration Progress Document
Last Updated: 2025-07-15

## Project Overview
Building a service that processes insurance transactions from Triton and transforms them into IMS API calls. The service handles 5 transaction types: Bind, Unbind, Issue, Midterm Endorsement, and Cancellation.

## Current Status: Working through Bind transaction errors

### What We've Accomplished ✅

1. **Project Structure**
   - Created modular FastAPI service with separate IMS service modules
   - Implemented base service pattern for IMS SOAP clients
   - Set up Docker configuration and environment management
   - Created comprehensive test scripts

2. **Authentication**
   - Fixed authentication from `Login` (wrong method) to `LoginIMSUser`
   - Successfully authenticating with IMS using encrypted credentials
   - Token management with auto-refresh

3. **Insured Creation**
   - Successfully creating insureds with proper object structure
   - Fixed BusinessTypeID from 1 to 9 (LLC - Partnership)
   - Insured search working correctly

4. **Submission Creation**
   - Successfully creating submissions with proper object structure
   - Using valid Producer GUID from environment

### Current Issues 🔧

1. **Quote Creation - DateTime Format Error**
   - Error: "String was not recognized as a valid DateTime"
   - The date format from Triton ("09/24/2025") may not match IMS expected format
   - Need to convert dates to proper XML date format (YYYY-MM-DD)

2. **Method Availability**
   - `AddQuoteWithSubmission` doesn't exist in this IMS instance
   - Falling back to separate calls (AddSubmission + AddQuote)

### Transaction Flow Progress

```
Bind Transaction:
1. ✅ Authenticate with IMS
2. ✅ Search for existing insured 
3. ✅ Create insured if not found
4. ✅ Create submission
5. ❌ Create quote (DateTime format issue)
6. ⏸️ Bind quote
7. ⏸️ Get invoice details
8. ⏸️ Store policy mapping
```

### Key Learnings

1. **IMS API Expectations**
   - All methods expect complex objects, not individual parameters
   - Strict type requirements (e.g., BusinessTypeID must exist in DB)
   - Date formats need to be XML-compliant
   - Some documented methods may not be available in all instances

2. **Environment-Specific GUIDs**
   - Producer: 895E9291-CFB6-4299-8799-9AF77DF937D6
   - Underwriter: E4391D2A-58FB-4E2D-8B7D-3447D9E18C88
   - Company Location: DF35D4C7-C663-4974-A886-A1E18D3C9618
   - Line: 07564291-CBFE-4BBE-88D1-0548C88ACED4

### Next Steps

1. **Fix DateTime Format**
   - Convert date strings from "MM/DD/YYYY" to "YYYY-MM-DD"
   - Apply to all date fields (effective, expiration, submission, bound dates)

2. **Consider Alternative Methods**
   - `AddQuoteWithInsured` could do everything in one call
   - Would eliminate the need for separate insured creation
   - Returns all GUIDs needed for subsequent operations

3. **Complete Bind Flow**
   - Fix quote creation
   - Implement binding
   - Add invoice retrieval
   - Store policy mappings

4. **Implement Remaining Transactions**
   - Unbind
   - Issue
   - Midterm Endorsement
   - Cancellation

### Technical Debt

1. Need proper policy lookup mechanism (currently using file-based storage)
2. Error handling could be more specific
3. Need to implement retry logic for transient failures
4. Should add request/response logging for debugging

### Questions to Resolve

1. Should we use `AddQuoteWithInsured` instead of separate calls?
2. What's the correct date format for IMS?
3. Are there other required fields we're missing?
4. How do we handle policy lookups for existing policies?
