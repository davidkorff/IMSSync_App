# RSG Integration Progress Document
Last Updated: 2025-07-15

## Project Overview
Building a service that processes insurance transactions from Triton and transforms them into IMS API calls. The service handles 5 transaction types: Bind, Unbind, Issue, Midterm Endorsement, and Cancellation.

## Current Status: Fixing null reference errors in quote creation

### What We've Accomplished ✅

1. **Project Structure**
   - Created modular FastAPI service with separate IMS service modules
   - Implemented base service pattern for IMS SOAP clients
   - Set up Docker configuration and environment management
   - Created comprehensive test scripts

2. **Authentication**
   - Fixed authentication from `Login` (wrong method) to `LoginIMSUser`
   - Successfully authenticating with IMS using encrypted credentials
   - Token management with auto-refresh

3. **Insured Creation**
   - Successfully creating insureds with proper object structure
   - Fixed BusinessTypeID from 1 to 9 (LLC - Partnership)
   - Insured search working correctly

4. **Submission Creation**
   - Successfully creating submissions with proper object structure
   - Using valid Producer GUID from environment

### Current Issues 🔧

1. ~~**Quote Creation - DateTime Format Error**~~ ✅ FIXED
   - Converted dates from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD format

2. ~~**Quote Creation - Null Reference Error**~~ ✅ FIXED
   - `AddQuoteWithInsured` method not available in this IMS instance
   - Fixed issues with AddQuote:
     - Changed empty strings to null values in RiskInformation
     - Removed TACSR field from quote object (only valid in submission)
     - AddQuote creates both submission and quote together (not separate calls)
     - Fixed decimal conversion error by converting commission rates from percentage to decimal
   - Current approach: AddInsured + AddQuote (which creates submission and quote)

3. ~~**RaterID Foreign Key Error**~~ ✅ FIXED
   - Changed default RaterID from 1 to 0 to avoid foreign key constraint

4. **Method Availability**
   - `AddQuoteWithSubmission` doesn't exist in this IMS instance
   - `AddQuoteWithInsured` also not available in this instance
   - Using fallback approach with separate API calls

### Transaction Flow Progress

```
Bind Transaction (CURRENT FLOW):
1. ✅ Authenticate with IMS
2. ✅ Search for existing insured 
3. ✅ Create insured if not found
4. ✅ Create submission and quote with AddQuote
5. ✅ Update external quote ID (UpdateExternalQuoteId)
6. 🔄 Store additional data (ImportNetRateXml - testing)
7. ⏸️ Bind quote
8. ⏸️ Get invoice details
9. ⏸️ Store policy mapping
```

### Key Learnings

1. **IMS API Expectations**
   - All methods expect complex objects, not individual parameters
   - Strict type requirements (e.g., BusinessTypeID must exist in DB)
   - Date formats need to be XML-compliant (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Some documented methods may not be available in all instances
   - AddQuote creates both submission and quote (not just quote)
   - TACSR field belongs in submission, not quote object

2. **Environment-Specific GUIDs**
   - Producer: 895E9291-CFB6-4299-8799-9AF77DF937D6
   - Underwriter: E4391D2A-58FB-4E2D-8B7D-3447D9E18C88
   - Company Location: DF35D4C7-C663-4974-A886-A1E18D3C9618
   - Line: 07564291-CBFE-4BBE-88D1-0548C88ACED4

### Recent Changes

1. **Implemented AddQuoteWithInsured**
   - Added new `create_quote_with_insured` method in QuoteService
   - Creates insured, location, submission, and quote in one atomic operation
   - Updated bind transaction flow to use this single-call approach
   - Eliminates null reference errors from multi-step process

2. **Updated Transaction Flow**
   - Removed the search-then-create pattern for insureds
   - Now creates everything fresh for each bind transaction
   - Simplified flow reduces potential error points

### Current Plan: Additional Data Storage

**Primary Approach (Testing Now):**
1. **UpdateExternalQuoteId** - Store Triton transaction_id with "TRITON" as system ID
2. **ImportNetRateXml** - Attempting to store additional Triton data as XML
   - Creating well-formed XML with Triton fields
   - Monitoring response to check for side effects
   - If successful, will continue using this method

**Fallback Approach (If ImportNetRateXml Fails):**
- Use AdditionalInformation field in Quote object
- Store data as JSON strings in the array
- Already part of quote structure, no extra calls needed

### Next Steps

1. **Test Current Implementation**
   - Run bind transaction with RaterID fix
   - Verify UpdateExternalQuoteId works
   - Monitor ImportNetRateXml behavior and response
   - Check for any unwanted side effects

2. **Complete Bind Flow**
   - ✅ Create insured/quote 
   - ✅ Update external ID
   - 🔄 Store additional data (testing approach)
   - ⏸️ Bind the quote
   - ⏸️ Get invoice details
   - ⏸️ Store policy mappings

3. **Implement Fallback if Needed**
   - If ImportNetRateXml causes issues, switch to AdditionalInformation
   - Update quote creation to include additional data

4. **Update Other Transactions**
   - Apply same data storage pattern to other transaction types
   - Ensure consistent approach across all flows

### Technical Debt

1. Need proper policy lookup mechanism (currently using file-based storage)
2. Error handling could be more specific
3. Need to implement retry logic for transient failures
4. Should add request/response logging for debugging

### Questions to Resolve

1. Should we use `AddQuoteWithInsured` instead of separate calls?
2. What's the correct date format for IMS?
3. Are there other required fields we're missing?
4. How do we handle policy lookups for existing policies?
