# RSG Integration Progress Document
Last Updated: 2025-07-15

## Project Overview
Building a service that processes insurance transactions from Triton and transforms them into IMS API calls. The service handles 5 transaction types: Bind, Unbind, Issue, Midterm Endorsement, and Cancellation.

## Current Status: Fixing null reference errors in quote creation

### What We've Accomplished ✅

1. **Project Structure**
   - Created modular FastAPI service with separate IMS service modules
   - Implemented base service pattern for IMS SOAP clients
   - Set up Docker configuration and environment management
   - Created comprehensive test scripts

2. **Authentication**
   - Fixed authentication from `Login` (wrong method) to `LoginIMSUser`
   - Successfully authenticating with IMS using encrypted credentials
   - Token management with auto-refresh

3. **Insured Creation**
   - Successfully creating insureds with proper object structure
   - Fixed BusinessTypeID from 1 to 9 (LLC - Partnership)
   - Insured search working correctly

4. **Submission Creation**
   - Successfully creating submissions with proper object structure
   - Using valid Producer GUID from environment

### Current Issues 🔧

1. ~~**Quote Creation - DateTime Format Error**~~ ✅ FIXED
   - Converted dates from MM/DD/YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD format

2. ~~**Quote Creation - Null Reference Error**~~ 🔄 IN PROGRESS
   - `AddQuoteWithInsured` method not available in this IMS instance
   - Reverted to multi-step approach with fixes:
     - Changed empty strings to null values in RiskInformation
     - Added missing TACSR field to quote object
   - Using separate calls: AddInsured + AddSubmission + AddQuote

3. **Method Availability**
   - `AddQuoteWithSubmission` doesn't exist in this IMS instance
   - `AddQuoteWithInsured` also not available in this instance
   - Using fallback approach with separate API calls

### Transaction Flow Progress

```
Bind Transaction (NEW FLOW):
1. ✅ Authenticate with IMS
2. ✅ Create insured, location, submission and quote with AddQuoteWithInsured
3. ⏸️ Bind quote
4. ⏸️ Get invoice details
5. ⏸️ Store policy mapping

Old Flow (deprecated):
1. ✅ Authenticate with IMS
2. ✅ Search for existing insured 
3. ✅ Create insured if not found
4. ✅ Create submission
5. ❌ Create quote (null reference error)
```

### Key Learnings

1. **IMS API Expectations**
   - All methods expect complex objects, not individual parameters
   - Strict type requirements (e.g., BusinessTypeID must exist in DB)
   - Date formats need to be XML-compliant
   - Some documented methods may not be available in all instances

2. **Environment-Specific GUIDs**
   - Producer: 895E9291-CFB6-4299-8799-9AF77DF937D6
   - Underwriter: E4391D2A-58FB-4E2D-8B7D-3447D9E18C88
   - Company Location: DF35D4C7-C663-4974-A886-A1E18D3C9618
   - Line: 07564291-CBFE-4BBE-88D1-0548C88ACED4

### Recent Changes

1. **Implemented AddQuoteWithInsured**
   - Added new `create_quote_with_insured` method in QuoteService
   - Creates insured, location, submission, and quote in one atomic operation
   - Updated bind transaction flow to use this single-call approach
   - Eliminates null reference errors from multi-step process

2. **Updated Transaction Flow**
   - Removed the search-then-create pattern for insureds
   - Now creates everything fresh for each bind transaction
   - Simplified flow reduces potential error points

### Next Steps

1. **Test New Implementation**
   - Validate AddQuoteWithInsured works correctly
   - Ensure bind operation completes successfully
   - Test invoice retrieval with new quote GUIDs
   - Verify policy mapping storage

2. **Complete Bind Flow**
   - ✅ Create insured/quote with AddQuoteWithInsured
   - ⏸️ Bind the quote
   - ⏸️ Get invoice details
   - ⏸️ Store policy mappings

3. **Update Other Transactions**
   - Consider if other transactions need similar atomic operations
   - Update flows to match new pattern where appropriate

4. **Implement Remaining Features**
   - Policy lookup for existing policies
   - Proper error handling and retry logic
   - Request/response logging for debugging

### Technical Debt

1. Need proper policy lookup mechanism (currently using file-based storage)
2. Error handling could be more specific
3. Need to implement retry logic for transient failures
4. Should add request/response logging for debugging

### Questions to Resolve

1. Should we use `AddQuoteWithInsured` instead of separate calls?
2. What's the correct date format for IMS?
3. Are there other required fields we're missing?
4. How do we handle policy lookups for existing policies?
