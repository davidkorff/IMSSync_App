# Bind Method Analysis

## Current Situation
We're trying to bind a quote but getting "Installment billing information not found" error.

## Available Bind Methods

### 1. BindQuote (Currently using)
- Takes: `quoteGuid` (GUID)
- Issue: Requires installment billing to be configured
- Status: ❌ Failing with installment billing error

### 2. BindQuoteWithInstallment
- Takes: `quoteGuid` (GUID), `companyInstallmentID` (int)
- Tried: Using -1 as companyInstallmentID
- Status: ❌ Still fails with same error

### 3. Bind (Preferred approach)
- Takes: `quoteOptionID` (int) - NOT a GUID!
- Documentation: "If the passed in QuoteOptionID does not reference the specified InstallmentBillingQuoteOptionID, then will be billed as single pay"
- This should bypass installment billing requirement!

### 4. BindWithInstallment
- Takes: `quoteOptionID` (int), `companyInstallmentID` (int)
- Not needed for our use case

## The Problem
1. `AddQuoteOption` returns a GUID, not an integer ID
2. `Bind` method needs an integer quote option ID
3. We need DataAccess to query the database to get the integer ID from the GUID

## DataAccess Issue
- Getting "Parameters must be specified in Key/Value pairs" error
- Tried removing @ symbol - didn't help
- The stored procedure `spGetQuoteOptions_WS` doesn't exist yet

## Current Approach
1. Try using Bind with common default IDs (1, 0, -1)
2. If that fails, fall back to BindQuote (which will fail with installment billing error)

## Solutions
1. **Create the stored procedure** `spGetQuoteOptions_WS` to map GUID to integer ID
2. **Configure installment billing** in IMS (admin task)
3. **Find the correct quote option ID** through other means

## Key Insight
The error message shows "quote ID 613644" - this is the integer ID we need!
But we don't have a way to get this ID without DataAccess working properly.
