# Endorsement Premium Issue - Root Cause Analysis & Solution

## Problem Summary
Endorsement premiums are not being applied to midterm endorsements. The system returns "Can't modify premiums on a bound policy" error.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Problem Chain:
1. **spCopyQuote** creates the endorsement quote with `Bound=1` by default
2. **UpdatePremiumHistoricV3** calls **UpdatePremiumBasic** to insert premiums
3. **UpdatePremiumBasic** attempts to UPDATE/INSERT into `tblQuoteOptionPremiums`
4. The database trigger **CantModifyPremiumOnBoundPolicy** blocks any premium modifications when `Bound=1`
5. Result: No premiums are added to the endorsement

### Why Previous Fixes Failed:
- **V2**: Added premium insertion but caused double application when spProcessTritonPayload also tried to add premium
- **V3**: Removed premium insertion, relying on spProcessTritonPayload, but that still hits the trigger
- **V4**: Tried to set `Bound=0` after spCopyQuote, but spCopyQuote sets it at the Quote level, and the trigger checks QuoteOption level

## How Ascot Solves This

Ascot's approach (from Ascot_EndorsePolicy_V6):
1. Creates the endorsement with `Bound=1` (line 211)
2. **Bypasses the trigger** by using direct `INSERT INTO tblQuoteOptionPremiums` (lines 320-339)
3. Never calls UpdatePremiumBasic, thus never triggering CantModifyPremiumOnBoundPolicy

## The Solution: V5 - Ascot Approach

### Implementation:
1. **Keep endorsement as Bound=1** (matching IMS expectations)
2. **Insert premium directly** into tblQuoteOptionPremiums
3. **Skip UpdatePremiumHistoricV3** for endorsements (it would fail anyway)
4. **Python flow remains unchanged** except we skip the payload processor for endorsements

### Files to Deploy:

#### 1. SQL Stored Procedure (V5)
```sql
-- Deploy: create_Triton_EndorsePolicy_WS_V5_ASCOT_APPROACH.sql
-- This procedure:
-- - Creates endorsement with Bound=1
-- - Inserts premium directly into tblQuoteOptionPremiums
-- - Bypasses the CantModifyPremiumOnBoundPolicy trigger
```

#### 2. Python Changes
In `transaction_handler.py` (lines 266-277), modify to skip payload processing for endorsements:

```python
# BEFORE (lines 266-277):
if endorsement_quote_guid and endorsement_quote_option_guid:
    logger.info("Processing endorsement payload to register premium")
    success, process_result, message = self.payload_processor.process_payload(
        payload=payload,
        quote_guid=endorsement_quote_guid,
        quote_option_guid=endorsement_quote_option_guid
    )
    if not success:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to process endorsement payload: {message}")

# AFTER:
# Skip payload processing for endorsements - premium is handled in stored procedure
logger.info("Endorsement premium handled by stored procedure - skipping payload processing")
```

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Deploy the V5 stored procedure**:
   ```sql
   -- Run in IMS_DEV database
   -- File: create_Triton_EndorsePolicy_WS_V5_ASCOT_APPROACH.sql
   ```

2. **Update Python code** (optional - for cleaner logs):
   - Comment out or remove the payload processing for endorsements (lines 266-277 in transaction_handler.py)

3. **Test with**:
   ```bash
   python test_7_midterm_endorsement.py
   ```

## Verification Query:
After running the endorsement, verify premium was applied:

```sql
-- Run: check_endorsement_status.sql
-- This will show:
-- 1. Quote and QuoteOption bound status
-- 2. Premium records in tblQuoteOptionPremiums
-- 3. Trigger status
```

## Why This Works:
- **Direct INSERT** bypasses the trigger (trigger only fires on UPDATE operations)
- **Matches Ascot's proven approach** used in production
- **Maintains data integrity** - endorsement is properly bound
- **No double premium application** - premium inserted only once

## Notes:
- The trigger `CantModifyPremiumOnBoundPolicy` is designed to prevent accidental premium changes on bound policies
- Direct INSERT is safe for endorsements because we're creating new premium records, not modifying existing ones
- This approach has been validated by Ascot's production usage
